      <p class="text-gray-600 text-lg mb-6">If you're a central Indiana homeowner considering a sprinkler system, you probably have questions. How much does it cost? What type of system is best? How do you maintain it through Indiana's wild weather swings? In this guide, we break down everything you need to know.</p>

      <h2 class="font-heading font-bold text-2xl text-green-dark mt-12 mb-4">Why Install an Irrigation System?</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 text-lg mb-6">Indiana summers bring heat and humidity, but rainfall is inconsistent. A properly designed irrigation system delivers the right amount of water to every part of your lawn on a consistent schedule — promoting deep root growth, preventing disease, and keeping your landscape green all season.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 text-lg mb-6">Beyond the obvious curb appeal, a well-maintained irrigation system can increase your property value by 5-15%. It also saves time — no more dragging hoses or moving portable sprinklers around your yard.</p>

      <h2 class="font-heading font-bold text-2xl text-green-dark mt-12 mb-4">Types of Sprinkler Systems</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 text-lg mb-4">There are two main types of sprinkler heads used in residential irrigation:</p>
      <div class="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-6 space-y-4">
        <div>
          <h3 class="font-heading font-bold text-green-dark">Rotor Heads</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-600">Best for large, open areas. They rotate to cover distances of 20-50 feet and deliver water slowly and evenly. Ideal for most Indiana lawns.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3 class="font-heading font-bold text-green-dark">Spray Heads</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-600">Best for smaller areas, garden beds, and narrow strips. They pop up and spray a fixed pattern, covering 4-15 feet. Great for flower beds and tight spaces.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="text-gray-600 text-lg mb-6">At Allen Irrigation, we use <strong>Rain Bird commercial products</strong> exclusively. While many companies use cheaper residential-grade equipment, commercial products last longer, perform better, and are what you'd find on a professional golf course. <a href="/services/irrigation" class="text-green-mid hover:text-green-dark underline">Learn more about our irrigation installation services.</a></p>

      <h2 class="font-heading font-bold text-2xl text-green-dark mt-12 mb-4">PVC vs. Poly Pipe</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 text-lg mb-6">One of the biggest differences between irrigation companies is the piping material. Many budget installers use flexible polyethylene (poly) pipe because it's faster to install. We use <strong>PVC piping</strong> on every job because it's more durable, handles Indiana's freeze-thaw cycles better, and maintains consistent water pressure throughout your system.</p>

      <h2 class="font-heading font-bold text-2xl text-green-dark mt-12 mb-4">What Does Installation Look Like?</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 text-lg mb-6">A typical residential irrigation installation takes 1-3 days depending on the size of your property. Here's the general process:</p>
      <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 text-gray-600 text-lg space-y-2 mb-6">
        <li><strong>Consultation & Design</strong> — We visit your property, discuss your needs, and design a custom system layout.</li>
        <li><strong>Utility Locating</strong> — We call 811 to have underground utilities marked before any digging.</li>
        <li><strong>Installation</strong> — Our crew installs the mainline, lateral pipes, valves, heads, and controller.</li>
        <li><strong>Testing & Adjustment</strong> — Every zone is tested and fine-tuned for optimal coverage.</li>
        <li><strong>Walkthrough</strong> — We show you how to operate your controller and answer any questions.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2 class="font-heading font-bold text-2xl text-green-dark mt-12 mb-4">Seasonal Maintenance in Indiana</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 text-lg mb-6">Central Indiana's four distinct seasons mean your irrigation system needs attention throughout the year:</p>

          <p class="text-gray-600">Monitor for broken heads or coverage issues. Adjust your watering schedule during hot, dry spells. Most lawns need about 1-1.5 inches of water per week.</p>

      <h2 class="font-heading font-bold text-2xl text-green-dark mt-12 mb-4">How Much Does an Irrigation System Cost?</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 text-lg mb-6">Costs vary based on property size, number of zones, and complexity. For a typical central Indiana residential property, you can expect to invest between $3,000 and $6,000 for a professionally installed system using commercial-grade components.</p>
