          <p class="text-gray-600 text-lg mb-6">After a long Indiana winter, your irrigation system needs more than just turning on the water. A proper spring startup ensures everything is functioning correctly, identifies any winter damage, and gets your system dialed in for the growing season ahead.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 text-lg mb-6">Our trained technicians follow a comprehensive checklist to bring your system back online safely and efficiently. We check every zone, inspect every head, test your backflow preventer, and adjust your controller schedule for spring watering needs.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 text-lg">We typically begin scheduling spring startups in <strong class="text-green-dark">late March through April</strong>, once the threat of hard freezes has passed. Spots fill quickly, so we recommend booking early.</p>
