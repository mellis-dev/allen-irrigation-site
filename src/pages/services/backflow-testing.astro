          <p class="text-gray-600 text-lg mb-6">Your irrigation system connects directly to your home or business's potable water supply. A backflow prevention device ensures that water from your sprinkler system can't flow backward into your drinking water — protecting your family or customers from contaminated water.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 text-lg mb-6">Many Indiana municipalities require annual backflow testing and certification to verify your device is working correctly. Failure to test can result in fines or having your water service shut off.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 text-lg">Allen Irrigation provides professional backflow testing, repair, and replacement services. We handle the testing, paperwork, and submission to your local water utility so you don't have to worry about a thing.</p>

          <h3 class="font-heading font-bold text-green-dark mb-2">How often do I need backflow testing?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-600">Most Indiana water utilities require annual testing. We recommend scheduling it during your <a href="/services/spring-startup" class="text-green-mid hover:text-green-dark underline">spring startup</a> for convenience.</p>

          <h3 class="font-heading font-bold text-green-dark mb-2">What happens if my backflow device fails?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-600">In most cases, we can repair or rebuild the device during the same visit. If a full replacement is needed, we'll provide an estimate and schedule the work promptly.</p>

          <h3 class="font-heading font-bold text-green-dark mb-2">Do I really need a backflow preventer?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-600">Yes. Indiana plumbing code requires backflow prevention on all irrigation system connections. Beyond the legal requirement, it's essential for protecting your drinking water from fertilizers, pesticides, and other contaminants.</p>
